## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox

### What I learned

Using Flexbox and arranging the components using flex features. Using media queries along with flex to change element sizes for smaller screens.

### Continued development

I would love to make this design using tailwind or SASS to improve my skills and later convert it to React as a SAP.
